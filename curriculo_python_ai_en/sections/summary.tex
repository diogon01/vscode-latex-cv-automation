\section{Professional Summary}

C++/Python Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in AI, computer vision, and drone robotics. Worked as a researcher at Labmetro/UFSC (VANT3D Project), responsible for deploying ROS/Gazebo, developing trajectory planning algorithms (Dijkstra, Euclidean distances), and creating vision pipelines with YOLO and OpenCV for industrial inspections with RPAS (Petrobras). Modeled 3D scenarios for simulation and algorithm validation, with proven results in real-world scenarios and embedded hardware (Jetson Nano). Experienced in deep learning (CIFAR-10, CNNs, detection, and 3D photogrammetry) and evolving Python prototypes into real-time C++ solutions. Currently focused on generative AI (LLMs, embeddings, RAG), integrating AI models into robust and scalable products.
